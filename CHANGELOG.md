## [1.1.1]

Updates:
* For unsaved files, we add the compare functionality so the user can see all modifications before saving.
* In settings, the user can define a list of labels to be ignored by the plugin, to reduce the amount of intent-types shown in the intent-types and intents list. When modified, the user will have to reload the vsCode window.

## [1.1.2]

Updates:
* Hide clear text password in settings.

## [1.2.0]

Updates:
* Logging for intent operations using output channels of vscode. Logs are cleaned up and use the correct severity.
* Moved plugin logging to log output channel of vscode (not console.log/warn/error anymore).
  * Setup loglevel as desired from UI.
  * Logging is available in normal production environment (no need to debug the plugin)
* Main script can be called either script-content.js or script-content.mjs when uploading from local system
* Support for subfolders under intent-type resources when uploading from local system
* Error handling improvements for malformed RESTCONF error messages

## [1.2.1]

Updates:
* Ignore hidden resource files folders
* Launch upload from local file-system from meta-info or script-content

## [2.0.0]

Updates:
* Code refactored to support next-gen JS engine
* More short-cuts added to explorer (including multi-select)
* Creation of new intent-types using templates
* Deletion of intent-types with intents (confirmation prompt)
* Audit reports using colors from vsCode theme (dark vs light)

## [2.1.0]

Fixes:
* Consistent usage of intent-type naming pattern (small caps, numbers, minus, underscore)
* Raise exception to let vsCode know, that deletion of intent-types with existing intents was cancelled
* Increased default timeout for REST calls from 20sec to 90sec for better robbustness

Updates:

Experimental:

Known limitations:
* Intent decoration is automatically updated by audit/sync methods to reduce server.
  In some error scenarios the displayed alignment state does not reflect the server state.

## [2.1.1]

Fixes:
* Upload intents and views from local machine (drag'n drop, copy/paste)
* Sanitized code for lint conformance

Updates:

## [2.4.0]

Fixes:

  extension will try to authenticate again.

Updates:

* Audit report format: For misaligned object entries with isConfigured equals false use different color
* Command `setPassword` can now be triggered from other extensions while passing the new password.

* New IPL!nk template for next-gen JavaScript engine (GraalJS)

## [2.5.1]

- Certain settings have been moved to workspace settings rather than global user settings.

- To allow for multi-server support, the active NSP server, the port, and connection details (user/pass) have been moved to workspace settings (window scope instead of application scope). This allows for different workspaces to connect to different NSP servers.

- Implemented a command function nokia-intent-manager.connect (Provides support for NSP-Connect extension):

- The command can be called by other extensions (NSP-connect - not released yet) to connect to the NSP server using certain credentials specified by the NSP-connect extension.

- This does not affect the current functionality of the IM extension.
